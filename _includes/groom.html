    Well writing about myself is awkward but writing about him is kind of dugeun dugeun (heartbeat), made me kind of
    shy. Well where should I start? Urghh this is embarrassing but okay okay we need to do this. So it all started in
    UNITEN, where he loves to tease me especially with his antics of kamek kitak ketuk (because I’m Sarawakian) and I
    always replied with “It is kamek kitak ketuk la”, since it made more sense. Then it went to he needed help with
    TOEFL (though there were others too) and went to constantly texting.
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    Here he was so caring, always ensuring that I’ve eaten. Always taking care of me I suppose and he kind of always
    give advices that open up my eyes (because I’m so naive and gullible, sometimes still am but is so much better now,
    at least that’s what I like to think). Well he really opened up my heart by really being caring and loving to the
    point that I said if its him, then its okay (yes cringe, I know, but I seriously wrote that in my diary back in
    2010).
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    So fast forward to where we are now, he is seriously still loving and caring and such a sweetheart at times, and
    despite all the crazy things I’ve done, here he is still with me. Plus he really loves his family, like he always
    talk about the things he want to do for them and it’s just really amazing because well I haven’t like reach to that
    level of thinking (I think about what I want to do in life instead of what can I do for my family, I guess it could
    be his first child syndrome trait, but still it’s amazing).
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    Apart from that, he is a great listener and is always ready to help a friend in need (like despite being an
    introvert, I can talk hours with him and he responded of course but also just truly listened, and that is
    great). Many of his friends would come to him and he will be there to listen and help them wherever needed.
    Sometimes he would go out of his way to help others, and that is something we have in common I suppose. We both
    would always want to try to help anyone in need as possible as we can (does that make sense? But you know what I
    mean).
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    Other than that, he is so hardworking, like he really really worked hard for his goals, to be better, to do
    better, to strive better. Sometimes he worked too hard, he don’t know how to rest. Please rest sometime, will you?
    It’s okay to take a break at times. Really. Stopping for a day wouldn’t harm. Okay I think I’m going all over the
    place now, so let’s conclude.
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    I mean we do go through all the ups and downs of a relationship and no one is ever truly perfect, but all in all,
    he likes to tease me, he’s funny, he loves me despite how crazy I am (and I can go from happy crazy to emotional
    hormonal crazy in seconds), he cares for me, he would do anything for me and truly he makes me happy. Hence, here I
    am, all ready to officially be his.

    Going to be 26 years old this year. Eldest child of 3 siblings. Graduated from Drake University with Actuarial
    Science and Information System. Studied at UNITEN for preparation prior to degree where I met Nadia and started to
    know each other. It felt weird writing about myself as I never have a diary in my life. But I thought this is a once
    in a lifetime experience to describe myself for the sake of one of the happiest days in my life.

    Have huge passion towards football and Liverpool is my favourite team. Trying to keep up with a healthy lifestyle.
    Well I gained 25 kg in a span of 4 years during my degree life (yes I know its crazy, that is why i need to be super
    dedicated in keeping up with a healthy lifestyle). Family will always be my priority especially being the eldest in
    the family with 2 siblings with quite an age gap. Believe that everyone deserve to be treated equally.
