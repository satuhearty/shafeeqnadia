  <p class="description">
    One of the most selfless and strong person I’ve ever known. Highly tolerable, patient and a caring person. Always
    positive and know how to cheer people up with her charm. A firm believer that equality and respect are important
    fundamental in this world. Focus on positivity and happiness.
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    People may see her as happy go lucky and a loud person. However in reality, she is still all that, but she is more
    of the quiet one and she would listen more than do the talking itself. This is why it is always safe to tell any
    secret to Nadia.
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    Nadia is also a very introvert person. She can be happy by just staying at home and always claimed that there are so
    many things to do at home which is somehow a good thing because you don’t have to make lots of efforts to make her
    happy (hehe joking). But unlike me, I can’t imagine sitting at home for a long time without talking or meeting
    people?
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    Hence, relating with her real character which is very quiet. But she is a very strong person when she has to be. She
    knows when the situation and people surrounding needed her, she can be the strongest person that you can imagine.
    Maybe not physically, but mentally she is and I’m proud of her. But of course I will do my best to be strong and
    take care of her as much as I could.
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    She is also someone who keeps her feelings to herself. Man I think it took us more than one year for her to finally
    open up to talk about herself with me. She just couldn’t express her feeling as she usually talked to her diaries.
    But most importantly is how well and kind she treats my parents when meeting them. She’s very polite, respectful and
    a caring person. After 7 years knowing and getting to know her, I certainly believe that she is really the one and
    we can fit very well together.

    Well okay this is kind of awkward having to write about yourself but here goes. Well I’m the second out of five
    siblings, I have a crazy older sister (though I’m crazier I’m sure, like I talk to myself and to objects as if they
    are human on a daily basis), a younger sister who’s less than a year apart, hence sometimes we are mistaken to be
    twins (mum used to dress us the same which didn’t help, and now we are getting married together so duhhh), an only
    baby brother (and will forever be my baby brother) and our youngest sister (who is always mistaken to be older than
    me because I’m younger looking (though honestly it’s just because I’m the smallest)).

    Well I am a proud introvert like yasss to being at home:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      reading (and when I read I would go all out to finish it in a day but would stop for a few seconds and hold my heart when the scene is too heartbreaking or too cheesy or whatever (like my heart beat would just escalate that it hurts sometimes), because I’m reading it as if I’m living the story and whatever is conveyed, I felt it wholeheartedly and it’s crazy how it just played with my heart)
    </li>
    <li>
      exercising (yes this is my new muse now especially running)
    </li>
    <li>
      listening to music (okay fine truth to be told K-pop, or to be more precise currently mostly (only) BTS), and
    </li>
    <li>
      dancing (and as long as there’s good music I can dance anywhere without shame or actually more to just grooving then actually dancing (honestly even without music playing, because there is always music playing in my head))
    </li>
  </ol>

    Though of course I enjoy few companies (family, cousins and friends) and usually when I’m with them, I kind of go
    introvert who? Especially when it comes to Sekolah Seri Puteri (SSP), my no 1 pride, I kind of like let my guard
    down and become really loud and all enthusiastic even though honestly I think I only laughed and shouted most of the
    time. Talking about SSP, it is one of the most important leap in my life where someone from Sarawak flew to West
    Malaysia at the age of 13 (always felt like Harry Potter being called to Hogwarts) and was enrolled into an all-girl
    boarding school. This is where I learned to be very enthusiastic and my ability to hype just about everything, but
    also the value of friendship, teamwork and just craziness. Anyway that was the best five years of my life, just love
    my spirit and love about everything - ORION 0509, Emerald, cheerleading, KRS, I seriously can go on and on.

    Alright, moving on, then I went to UNITEN for my prep to go to the States and well that’s where my life took a turn
    because this is where I met the love of my life (okay cringe), then it all went down to history. I went to Drake to
    where he was and just let our story bloomed. Though in Drake is where I learned different kind of struggles and had
    different ups and downs but that’s where I finally get to know my true friends. So with all that said, here we are
    now. So I guess that’s enough about me. Cheers!
