  <h3 class="major">By Groom</h3>
  <p class="description">
    One of the most selfless and strong person I’ve ever known. Highly tolerable, patient and a caring person. Always
    positive and know how to cheer people up with her charm. A firm believer that equality and respect are important
    fundamental in this world. Focusing on positivity and happiness.
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    Nadia is a very introvert person. She can be happy by just staying at home and always claimed that there are so many
    things to do at home which is somehow a good thing because you don’t have to make lots of efforts to make her happy
    (hehe joking). But unlike me, I can’t imagine how can you just sit at home for a long time without talking or
    meeting people? Hence, relating with her real character which is very quiet.
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    But she is a very strong person when she has to be. She knows when the situation and people surrounding need her,
    she can be the strongest person that you can imagine. Maybe not physically, but mentally she is and I’m proud of
    her. But of course I will do my best to be strong and take care of her as much as I could. People may see her as
    happy go lucky and a loud person. However in reality she is still happy go lucky, but more of the quiet one and she
    would listen more than do the talking itself. This is why it is always safe to tell any secret to Nadia.
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    She is also someone who keep her feelings to herself. Man I think it took us more than one year to finally make her
    open up to talk about herself with me. She just couldn’t express her feeling as she usually talked to her diaries.
  </p>
  <h3 class="major">By Bride</h3>
  <p class="description">
    Well okay this is kind of awkward having to write about yourself but here goes. Well I’m the second out of five
    siblings, I have a crazy older sister (though I’m crazier I’m sure, like I talk to myself and to objects as if they
    are human on a daily basis), a younger sister who’s less than a year apart, hence sometimes we are mistaken to be
    twins (mum used to dress us the same which didn’t help, and now we are getting married together so duhhh), an only
    baby brother (and will forever be my baby brother) and our youngest sister (who is always mistaken to be older than
    me because I’m younger looking, I know thank you (though honestly it’s just because I’m the smallest)).
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    Well I am a proud introvert like yasss to being at home reading (and when I read I would like go all out to finish
    it in a day but sometimes I need to stop for a few seconds and like hold my heart because either the story is too
    heartbreaking or too cheesy or whatever, because I’m reading it as if I’m living the story and whatever is conveyed,
    I felt it wholeheartedly as if it was me and it’s crazy and sometimes it just played with my heart, like there is
    one f an-fiction, well make it two, I took like more than two weeks to recover from it, like why do you have to
    dieeeeee?? So yeah that is me with reading), exercising (yes this is my new muse now especially running), listening
    to music (okay fine truth to be told K-pop, or to be more precise currently mostly BTS) and dancing (and like
    honestly as long as there’s good music I can dance anywhere without shame or act more to just grooving then actually
    dancing (honestly even without music playing, because there is always music playing in my head and I can dance to
    that)).
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    Though of course I enjoy few companies (family, cousins and friends) and usually when I’m with them, I kind of go
    introvert who? Especially when it comes to Sekolah Seri Puteri (SSP), my no 1 pride, I kind of like let my guard
    down and become really loud and all enthusiastic just like how I was in school even though honestly I think I only
    laughed and shouted most of the time instead of talking but owh well.
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    Talking about SSP, it is one of the most important leap in my life where someone from Sarawak flew to West Malaysia
    at the age of 13 (always felt like Harry Potter being called to Hogwarts) and was enrolled into SSP and boy that is
    the most beautiful moment of my life (it still is, no kidding). This is where I learned to be very enthusiastic and
    hype about almost everything (I discovered how much energy I have in me in being so supportive and cheering), but
    also the value of friendship, teamwork and just craziness (seriously there are so many memories that I would really
    want to relive, though one regret is that, why was I so skema back then, I wished I had break at least one rule to
    make it a bit more memorable). But anyway that was the best five years of my life, just love my spirit and love
    about everything - ORION, Emerald, cheerleading, KRS, I seriously can go on and on.
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    So yes I know I’m out of school for 9 years now, but I will never let the spirit die (Capt Emerald mode on, so I’m
    sorry future daughters you guys might be brainwashed from the start to have that SSP spirit). Alright, moving on,
    then I went to UNITEN for my prep to go to the States and well that’s where my life took a turn because this is
    where I met the love of my life (okay cringe, like seriously I need 3 mins to calm down from the cringeness to write
    this down), then it all went down to history.
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    I went to Drake University (Drake) to where he was and just let our story bloomed. Though in Drake is where I
    learned different kind of struggles and had different ups and downs but that’s where I finally get to find my true
    friends. So with all that said, here we are now. So I guess that’s enough about me. Thanks for reading I suppose.
    Cheers!

  <p class="description">
    Well writing about myself is awkward but writing about him is kind of dugeun dugeun (heartbeat), made me kind of
    shy. Well where should I start? Urghh this is embarrassing but okay okay we need to do this. So it all started in
    UNITEN, where he loves to tease me especially with his antics of kamek kitak ketuk (because I’m Sarawakian) and I
    always replied with “It is kamek kitak ketuk la”, since it made more sense. Then it went to he needed help with
    TOEFL (though there were others too) and went to constantly texting.
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    Here he was so caring, always ensuring that I’ve eaten. Always taking care of me I suppose and he kind of always
    give advices that open up my eyes (because I’m so naive and gullible, sometimes still am but is so much better now,
    at least that’s what I like to think). Well he really opened up my heart by really being caring and loving to the
    point that I said if its him, then its okay (yes cringe, I know, but I seriously wrote that in my diary back in
    2010).
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    So fast forward to where we are now, he is seriously still loving and caring and such a sweetheart at times, and
    despite all the crazy things I’ve done, here he is still with me. Plus he really loves his family, like he always
    talk about the things he want to do for them and it’s just really amazing because well I haven’t like reach to that
    level of thinking (I think about what I want to do in life instead of what can I do for my family, I guess it could
    be his first child syndrome trait, but still it’s amazing).
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    Apart from that, he is a great listener and is always ready to help a friend in need (like despite being an
    introvert, I can talk hours with him and he responded of course but also just truly listened, and that is
    great). Many of his friends would come to him and he will be there to listen and help them wherever needed.
    Sometimes he would go out of his way to help others, and that is something we have in common I suppose. We both
    would always want to try to help anyone in need as possible as we can (does that make sense? But you know what I
    mean).
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    Other than that, he is so hardworking, like he really really worked hard for his goals, to be better, to do
    better, to strive better. Sometimes he worked too hard, he don’t know how to rest. Please rest sometime, will you?
    It’s okay to take a break at times. Really. Stopping for a day wouldn’t harm. Okay I think I’m going all over the
    place now, so let’s conclude.
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    I mean we do go through all the ups and downs of a relationship and no one is ever truly perfect, but all in all,
    he likes to tease me, he’s funny, he loves me despite how crazy I am (and I can go from happy crazy to emotional
    hormonal crazy in seconds), he cares for me, he would do anything for me and truly he makes me happy. Hence, here I
    am, all ready to officially be his.

    Going to be 26 years old this year. Eldest child of 3 siblings. Graduated from Drake University with Actuarial
    Science and Information System. Studied at UNITEN for preparation prior to degree where I met Nadia and started to
    know each other. It felt weird writing about myself as I never have a diary in my life. But I thought this is a once
    in a lifetime experience to describe myself for the sake of one of the happiest days in my life.
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    Have huge passion towards football and Liverpool is my favourite team. Trying to keep up with a healthy lifestyle.
    Well I gained 25 kg in a span of 4 years during my degree life (yes I know its crazy, that is why i need to be super
    dedicated in keeping up with a healthy lifestyle). Family will always be my priority especially being the eldest in
    the family with 2 siblings with quite an age gap. Believe that everyone deserve to be treated equally.

            are even though currently we are not living under their roof (in the dorm at the time), so that they are
            always aware of our whereabouts. You know because when you are in uni, you don’t bother telling your parents
            where you go but he did. Thus, the start of our relationship.
