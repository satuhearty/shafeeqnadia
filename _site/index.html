  <h2 class="major">The Bride</h2>
  <h3 class="major">By Groom</h3>
  <p class="description">
    One of the most selfless and strong person I’ve ever known. Highly tolerable, patient and a caring person. Always
    positive and know how to cheer people up with her charm. A firm believer that equality and respect are important
    fundamental in this world. Focus on positivity and happiness.
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    People may see her as happy go lucky and a loud person. However in reality, she is still all that, but she is more
    of the quiet one and she would listen more than do the talking itself. This is why it is always safe to tell any
    secret to Nadia.
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    Nadia is also a very introvert person. She can be happy by just staying at home and always claimed that there are so
    many things to do at home which is somehow a good thing because you don’t have to make lots of efforts to make her
    happy (hehe joking). But unlike me, I can’t imagine sitting at home for a long time without talking or meeting
    people?
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    Hence, relating with her real character which is very quiet. But she is a very strong person when she has to be. She
    knows when the situation and people surrounding needed her, she can be the strongest person that you can imagine.
    Maybe not physically, but mentally she is and I’m proud of her. But of course I will do my best to be strong and
    take care of her as much as I could.
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    She is also someone who keeps her feelings to herself. Man I think it took us more than one year for her to finally
    open up to talk about herself with me. She just couldn’t express her feeling as she usually talked to her diaries.
    But most importantly is how well and kind she treats my parents when meeting them. She’s very polite, respectful and
    a caring person. After 7 years knowing and getting to know her, I certainly believe that she is really the one and
    we can fit very well together.

  <p class="description">
    Well okay this is kind of awkward having to write about yourself but here goes. Well I’m the second out of five
    siblings, I have a crazy older sister (though I’m crazier I’m sure, like I talk to myself and to objects as if they
    are human on a daily basis), a younger sister who’s less than a year apart, hence sometimes we are mistaken to be
    twins (mum used to dress us the same which didn’t help, and now we are getting married together so duhhh), an only
    baby brother (and will forever be my baby brother) and our youngest sister (who is always mistaken to be older than
    me because I’m younger looking (though honestly it’s just because I’m the smallest)).

  <p class="description">
    Well I am a proud introvert like yasss to being at home:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      reading (and when I read I would go all out to finish it in a day but would stop for a few seconds and hold my heart when the scene is too heartbreaking or too cheesy or whatever (like my heart beat would just escalate that it hurts sometimes), because I’m reading it as if I’m living the story and whatever is conveyed, I felt it wholeheartedly and it’s crazy how it just played with my heart)
    </li>
    <li>
      exercising (yes this is my new muse now especially running)
    </li>
    <li>
      listening to music (okay fine truth to be told K-pop, or to be more precise currently mostly (only) BTS), and
    </li>
    <li>
      dancing (and as long as there’s good music I can dance anywhere without shame or actually more to just grooving then actually dancing (honestly even without music playing, because there is always music playing in my head))
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p class="description">
    Though of course I enjoy few companies (family, cousins and friends) and usually when I’m with them, I kind of go
    introvert who? Especially when it comes to Sekolah Seri Puteri (SSP), my no 1 pride, I kind of like let my guard
    down and become really loud and all enthusiastic even though honestly I think I only laughed and shouted most of the
    time. Talking about SSP, it is one of the most important leap in my life where someone from Sarawak flew to West
    Malaysia at the age of 13 (always felt like Harry Potter being called to Hogwarts) and was enrolled into an all-girl
    boarding school. This is where I learned to be very enthusiastic and my ability to hype just about everything, but
    also the value of friendship, teamwork and just craziness. Anyway that was the best five years of my life, just love
    my spirit and love about everything - ORION 0509, Emerald, cheerleading, KRS, I seriously can go on and on.

  <p class="description">
    Alright, moving on, then I went to UNITEN for my prep to go to the States and well that’s where my life took a turn
    because this is where I met the love of my life (okay cringe), then it all went down to history. I went to Drake to
    where he was and just let our story bloomed. Though in Drake is where I learned different kind of struggles and had
    different ups and downs but that’s where I finally get to know my true friends. So with all that said, here we are
    now. So I guess that’s enough about me. Cheers!

  <p class="description">
    Well writing about myself is awkward but writing about him made me kind of shy. But well where should I start? So
    it all started in UNITEN, where he loves to tease me especially with his antics of kamek kitak ketuk (because I’m
    Sarawakian) and I always replied with “It is kamek kitak ketuk la”, since it made more sense. Then it went to
    where he needed help with TOEFL (though there were others too) and to constantly texting.
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    Here he was so caring, always ensuring that I’ve eaten. Always taking care of me I suppose and he kind of always
    give advices that open up my eyes (because I’m so naive and gullible, sometimes still am but is so much better now,
    at least that’s what I like to think). Well he really opened up my heart by being really caring and loving to the
    point that I said if it’s him, then its okay (yes cringe, I know, but I seriously wrote that in my diary back in
    2010).
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    So fast forward to where we are now, he is seriously still loving and caring and such a sweetheart at times, and
    despite all the crazy things I’ve done, here he is still with me. Plus he really loves his family, like he always
    talk about the things he want to do for them and it’s just really amazing because well I haven’t reach to that
    level of thinking yet (I think about what I want to do in life instead of what can I do for my family, I guess it
    could be his first child syndrome trait, but still it’s amazing).
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    Apart from that, he is a great listener and is always ready to help a friend in need. Many of his friends would come to him and he will be there to listen and help them wherever needed. Sometimes he would go out of his way to help others, and that is something we have in common I suppose. We both would always want to try to help anyone in need as possible as we can. Other than that, he is so hardworking, like he really really worked hard for his goals, to be better, to do better, to strive better. Sometimes he worked too hard, he don’t know how to rest. I think I’m going all over the place now, so let’s conclude.
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    Other than that, he is so hardworking, like he really really worked hard for his goals, to be better, to do better,
    to strive better. Sometimes he worked too hard, he don’t know how to rest. Please rest sometime, will you? It’s okay
    to take a break at times. Really. Stopping for a day wouldn’t harm. Okay I think I’m going all over the place now,
    so let’s conclude.
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    I mean we do go through all the ups and downs of a relationship and no one is ever truly perfect, but all in all, he
    likes to tease me, he’s funny, he loves me despite how crazy I am (and I can go from happy crazy to emotional
    hormonal crazy in seconds), he cares for me, he would do anything for me and he truly makes me happy. Hence, here I
    am, all ready to officially be his.

  <p class="description">
    It feels really weird to write this as I never own any diary in my life. However since this is a lifetime experience
    for the happiest day of my life, I told Nadia “Okay, I’m down for this”. So to start, I’m going to be 26 years old
    this year. In fact me and Nadia were born on the same month as our wedding month. I am the eldest out of three
    siblings with a brother and a sister who are currently studying in university.
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    Family has always been (and always will) be my priority and nothing can top that. Being the eldest in the family and
    having an age gap of 6 & 7 years apart with my siblings definitely sparked a higher sense of protection and
    attention towards them in me.

  <span class="image main"><img data-src="assets/images/groom-by-groom-3.jpg" alt="Groom By Groom 3"></span>
  <p class="description">
    Other than that, I value friendship very much. I enjoyed having several close friends back in school, but I truly
    learnt the value of friendship when I enrolled in SASER after PMR. Here, we went through the hustle and hardships
    together during our 2 years in school. I now believe the saying “High school friends are your lifelong friends”.
    They are the one who can just click, talk and laugh together even though you have not met them after some time.
    These are my closest circle that I will forever treasure.
  </p>
  <span class="image main"><img data-src="assets/images/groom-by-groom-4.jpg" alt="Groom By Groom 4"></span>
  <p class="description">
    Then I enrolled in UNITEN for my overseas prep and met a bunch of good friends and Nadia (I will describe more on
    our meeting in the next section). I pursued my study in Drake University (Drake) starting from Aug 2011 and was
    joined by Nadia a year later. I would say that I had a roller coaster journey here but it is a memorable one. Now
    that I am done with my studies, I started my career journey in EY and has been stuck here ever since.

  <p class="description">
    I am a huge football fan and Liverpool is my favourite team. Currently, I am trying to keep up with a healthy
    lifestyle. Well it’s because I gained 25 kg in a span of 4 years during my time in Drake (yes I know it’s crazy,
    that is why i need to be super dedicated in keeping up with a healthy lifestyle). It is a good thing that Nadia is
    also together with me in this journey to be healthier.

        little girl with a strong will but is always considerate of others feelings. Growing up, she has matured into an
        enthusiastic, cheerful and kind-hearted 26 year old woman with a signature loud laugh. The sound of her laugh is
        directly proportionate to Nadia's level happiness and comfort. As an elder cousin, her successful academic
        achievements were a benchmark I had to catch up with and maintain. Nadia is a dreamer, not a fighter. She is
        sentimental, a worry wort and prefers comfort over style. Left to her own devices, Nadia fills her time with
        K-pop, running and planning. The Nadia I know is particular, extra, health-conscious and a good listener. Her
        avid imagination and passionate heart keeps me wondering and worrying what the future Nadia will get up to next.

        Bey is a lot of things to me, we got really close when we shared the same dorm in F3, and we could talk about
        anything, lots of things (mostly our body, dance, music and sometimes deeper stuff which is great because
        there’s not many that we could talk with on such deep topics).  She’s the most outspoken in our group and she’s
        my fave emo partner that I could ever ask for (we did go through this emo phase during high school).

        Nadia. She’s basically one of the most amazing people that I know. She has a beautiful mind, a kind heart and a
        fierce spirit that can shake the earth to its core. Although, with all that said, her humble nature always takes
        the upper hand. I’m glad we crossed paths, neddy. Truly.

        Nadia is the MOST down-to-earth and carefree person I have ever known. She may look soft and sweet on the
        outside, but knowing her I think she’s hardcore af and can rule the world if she wants to! Among the four of us,
        (Sheikh and Nadia, me and my husband Syazwan), I befriended Sheikh first so I know how ruthless he can be.. But
        then Nadia came and I was AMAZED realizing that she’s the only who can tame him 😄 but they are both amazing
        friends in their own way, so together they’re definitely a match made from Heaven. Appreciate you guys for

        Sheikh Shafeeq<br><br>
        How should i start? Hmm..yeah of course an enthusiast Liverpool supporter. When we were in SASER, Sheikh and few
        other friends Aiman Ros, Kirin & Emi, we are the companion so called die hard fans to watch Liverpool game.<br><br>
        As a person, Sheikh is a nice guy. We are very close and share lots of things especially on work & life
        experiences. He is very smart as well. Add Math is his piece of cake. Yeah everyone knows that. A good teacher
        to me and to others. An ambitious guy with clear goals that he wants to achieve.<br><br>
        Well my friend, I would like to wish you Selamat Pengantin Baru & Semoga Berbahagia Selalu. I’ll pray for your
        happiness & blessings in life. Can’t wait for this July.
